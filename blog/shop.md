We built this open-source e-commerce shop with Deno Deploy, Shopify's Storefront
API, and our in-house CSS library, [Fart.css](/css). You are able to see the
[source code](https://github.com/FartLabs/store) for the FartLabs Shop on
GitHub, so you know it's a legit lovechild between open-source tech and
cutting-edge web development.

We even borrowed some inspiration from the awesome Deno merch store (thanks
denoland/merch!). This means a smooth, intuitive shopping experience for you,
and a tribute to what's possible. We're all about transparency and sharing our
process, so feel free to dive into the code and see how it all works. Maybe
it'll even inspire your next project!
