We're super excited to announce the launch of the official FartLabs merch store!
We're kicking things off with the must-have accessory of the season: the
FartLabs Baseball Cap!

<!-- **(High-quality image of the FartLabs Baseball Cap here)** -->

This isn't your average swag. We built this open-source e-commerce store with
Deno Deploy, Shopify's powerful Storefront API, and Fart.css. You are able to
see the [source code](https://github.com/FartLabs/store) for the FartLabs Shop
on GitHub, so you know it's a legit lovechild between open-source tech and
cutting edge web development.

We even borrowed some inspiration from the awesome Deno merch store (thanks
denoland/merch!). This means a smooth, intuitive shopping experience for you,
and a tribute to what's possible. We're all about transparency and sharing our
process, so feel free to dive into the code and see how it all works. Maybe
it'll even inspire your next project!

## Why this matters to you (besides looking awesome)

  building innovative and, let's be honest, sometimes a little weird, projects.

  introductory price. This offer won't last forever, so don't miss out!
- **Join the Community:** Rocking the FartLabs merch is a way to connect with a
  community of like-minded individuals who appreciate a good blend of tech and,
  well, you know...farts.
