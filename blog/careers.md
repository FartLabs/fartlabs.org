## Join our team!

Hey there! We're a bunch of scientists, engineers, and operators who get excited
about building developer tools, games, and innovative projects that actually put
users in the driver's seat of their digital experience.

## Core values

| Value           | Description                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Empathy**     | Understanding and sharing the feelings of others     |
| **Honesty**     | Being truthful and transparent in all interactions   |
| **Inclusivity** | Creating an environment where everyone feels welcome |
| **Openness**    | Embracing new ideas and diverse perspectives         |
| **Curiosity**   | Always asking questions and seeking to learn         |

## Guiding principles

Democracy of ideas, high standards, ownership, simplicity, continuous
improvement, mutual support, impact, and getting things done.

## Our philosophy

- Own your data: favor plain files and SQLite so your work stays yours.
- Local-first by default: your notes and ideas stay on your machine unless you
  choose otherwise.
- Open source by default: transparent, auditable, and forkable.
- Use any model: bring your own keys and choose the tools that work for you.
- Interoperable by design: plain text and standard tooling to avoid lock-in.
- Performance and pragmatism: modern stack and fast paths that respect your
  time.

## Organic software

Like farming, you can factory‑scale or grow the good stuff. We choose the
latter.

- Not on the VC ferris wheel: built to last, not to flip.
- Clear pricing page.
- Transparent about funding sources and revenue.

## OSS contributions

We are looking for open-source contributors on a per-project basis across
FartLabs repos and adjacent ecosystems. We scope contributions collaboratively
based on impact, priority, and fit.
