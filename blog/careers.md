## Join our team!

Hey there! We're an AI lab of scientists, engineers, and operators who get
excited about building developer tools, games, and innovative projects that
actually put users in the driver's seat of their digital experience.

## Core values

- **Empathy**: Understanding and sharing the feelings of others
- **Honesty**: Being truthful and transparent in all interactions
- **Inclusivity**: Creating an environment where everyone feels welcome
- **Openness**: Embracing new ideas and diverse perspectives
- **Curiosity**: Always asking questions and seeking to learn

## Guiding principles

Democracy of ideas, high standards, ownership, simplicity, continuous
improvement, mutual support, impact, and getting things done.

## Our philosophy

- Own your data: favor plain files and SQLite so your work stays yours.
- Local-first by default: your notes and ideas stay on your machine unless you
  choose otherwise.
- Open source by default: transparent, auditable, and forkable.
- Use any model: bring your own keys and choose the tools that work for you.
- Interoperable by design: plain text and standard tooling to avoid lock-in.
- Performance and pragmatism: modern stack and fast paths that respect your
  time.

## Organic software

Like farming, you can factory‑scale or grow the good stuff. We choose the
latter.

- Not on the VC ferris wheel: built to last, not to flip.
- Clear pricing page.
- Transparent about funding sources and revenue.

## Our benefits

We're all about taking care of our FartLabs team members, both now and in the
future. Our comprehensive benefits are designed to support your physical,
financial, and emotional well-being. Everyone has a place at FartLabs.

- Like-minded team and challenging, rewarding work
