## Winning projects

Thank you all for participating in FartHacks 2025! Here are the winners for each
vertical.

### Most fun: Kusai

[Kusai](https://kusai-921.deno.dev/) is an engaging anime song guessing game
designed for fans of anime music. The user interface is styled with Fart.css and
engineered using `@fartlabs/htx` for rendering HTML and a `@fartlabs/rt` HTTP
router.

### Best use of AI: Fart or Art

[Fart or Art](https://github.com/sidvasu/Fart-or-Art) uses a machine learning
model trained on a public dataset to classify audio clips. Users can upload
short audio clips and the application will accurately determine whether the
sound is a fart or not a fart through a web interface.

### Most practical: Hack Comet

[Hack Comet](https://hack-comet.deno.dev/) is a platform for creating, sharing,
and managing hackathon team contracts. The contracts clarify responsibilities
and expectations, ensuring all team members are on the same page. Hack Comet
leverages `ts-declarative` to generate a JSON Schema validator for the contract
model. The project also utilizes `@fartlabs/htx` for HTML rendering and
`@fartlabs/rt` for the backend.

### Most futuristic: Scale of FartLabs

The **Scale of FartLabs**, inspired by "The Scale of the Universe", illustrates
the origins and evolution of FartLabs' foundational concepts, highlighting how
ideas expand in scale, scope, and impact as we evolve. It leverages
`@fartlabs/rt` for server-side rendering (SSR).

### Best use of FartLabs tech: Kusai

[Kusai](https://kusai-921.deno.dev/) also earns the **Best Use of FartLabs
Tech** award for its innovative use of Fart.css, `@fartlabs/htx`, and
`@fartlabs/rt` to create a fun and engaging user experience. The project
demonstrates the power of FartLabs technology in building interactive and
entertaining applications.

### Ethan's favorite: Kusai

Ethan reviewed the hackathon projects and chose
[Kusai](https://kusai-921.deno.dev/) as his favorite project.
