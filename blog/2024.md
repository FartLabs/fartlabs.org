FartLabs has been crop dusting innovation and collaboration in 2024. Let's
reflect on our journey and look ahead to the future.

## Year of firsts

In 2024, FartLabs, as it is known today, was born. Our goals are ambitious, but
our vision is clear: walled gardens will fall and make room for a new era of
user-centric FOSS (free, open-source shit). Read more about our mission in a
[previous blog post](/about).

## Deno Subhosting Hackathon

In January, our journey began with a meteoric start at the
[Deno Subhosting Hackathon](https://deno.com/blog/subhosting-hackathon) where
our project, [Deno Blocks](https://github.com/FartLabs/deno_blocks), won
"[Ryan Dahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl)'s Favorite" and "Most
Fun". It was a fateful opportunity to integrate a cloud IDE with the **Deno
Deploy** platform and challenge our problem-solving and technical skills.

## jsonx

In February, we started developing [jsonx](https://github.com/FartLabs/jsonx), a
JSX runtime to compose all kinds of JavaScript objects via JSX syntax.

```tsx
function Cat() {
  return { animals: ["üêà"] };
}

function Dog() {
  return { animals: ["üêï"] };
}

const data = (
  <>
    <Cat />
    <Dog />
  </>
);

console.log(data); // { animals: ["üêà", "üêï"] }
```

In March, we shipped a [jsonx documentation website](https://jsonx.fart.tools)
which includes an in-browser IDE where users can experiment and play with jsonx
and see the results in real-time.

## Routing and hypertext

In April, we launched [rt](https://github.com/FartLabs/rt), a TypeScript library
for conveniently handling HTTP requests. We also released
[rtx](https://github.com/FartLabs/rtx), a companion jsonx component library to
design HTTP servers via JSX syntax.

In addition, we launched [ht](https://github.com/FartLabs/ht), a TypeScript
library for rendering HTML elements with type-safe attributes. This library is
used in [htx](https://github.com/FartLabs/htx) to render HTML elements via JSX
syntax.

```tsx
import { A, BODY, H1, P } from "@fartlabs/htx";
import { Get, Router } from "@fartlabs/rtx";

const router = (
  <Router default={() => new Response("Not found", { status: 404 })}>
    <Get
      pattern="/"
      handle={() =>
        new Response(
          <BODY>
            <H1>Hello, World!</H1>
            <P>This is a paragraph.</P>
            <A href="https://jsr.io/@fartlabs/htx">@fartlabs/htx</A>
          </BODY>,
        )}
    />
  </Router>
);

if (import.meta.main) {
  Deno.serve((request) => router.fetch(request));
}
```

rtx and htx play nicely together, allowing for routing and hypertext components
to create a full-stack web experience via JSX syntax in the same TypeScript
file, all using one (jsonx) JSX runtime.

With htx, we built this website you are currently reading, [FartLabs.org](/).

## Grid of QR codes

In May, we began prototyping a practical intersection of physical and digital
worlds with [qr_grid](https://github.com/FartLabs/qr_grid). This project
generates customizable, printable QR code grids, enabling seamless transitions
between tactile materials and digital resources.

[![QR code sticker grid photo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbbdc682-c362-4002-9c33-ea7aab5f24a6)](https://github.com/FartLabs/qr_grid)

Whether for research or productivity, QR codes in physical formats, like
stickers, are a step towards bridging these realms. Inspired by
[Andrew Sutherland's talk](https://youtu.be/Y8Qm48_GhJ8), we aim to empower
thought work with accessible, hybrid interfaces.

## Social media presence

In June, we expanded our online presence with a new
[**Twitter/X account**](https://go.fart.tools/twitter) and
[**Discord server**](https://go.fart.tools/chat). We even launched
[a tool](https://github.com/FartLabs/feeder) for posting an announcement when a
new post is published on our blog. These platforms provide a space for
developers and enthusiasts to innovate with us and gives us the ability to
announce new projects and updates and reach a broader audience. Connect with us
on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/FartLabs),
[**Bluesky**](https://bsky.app/profile/fartlabs.org),
[**Twitter/X**](https://go.fart.tools/twitter),
[**Discord**](https://go.fart.tools/chat),
[**Instagram**](https://go.fart.tools/instagram), and
[**LinkedIn**](https://go.fart.tools/in).

Additionally, we released a new CSS library,
[Fart.css](https://github.com/FartLabs/fart.css), complete with
[documentation website](https://css.fart.tools/). Fart.css is designed with
minimalism and ease-of-use in mind, providing developers with a flexible
foundation for building <span class="fart-sparkle">fart-tastic</span>
interfaces.

  </a>
</div>

## Itemized operating systems

In July, we studied [Alexander Obenauer](https://alexanderobenauer.com/)'s work
on itemized operating systems, investigating modular architectures where
individual digital resources are treated as movable, self-contained "items."
This approach, exemplified by **Obenauer**'s lab notes, presents intriguing
possibilities for user customization and seamless data integration across
applications.

To further explore these concepts, we developed a
[TypeScript implementation](https://github.com/FartLabs/item_drive) of
**Obenauer**'s item drive and coordinated concepts. This practical
implementation allowed us to experiment with real-world applications, gaining
valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of the itemized approach.

Our research revealed that **Obenauer**'s itemized approach to computation
carries interdisciplinary relevance. We observed intriguing similarities with
existing [**Semantic Web**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web)
standards such as
[**RDF**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework). This
connection suggests promising avenues for future research and development,
intended for interoperable systems which put the user into the development loop,
improving experiences for managing and sharing digital information.

## Concentration

In August, we released an auditory memory game titled, **Fart Concentration**.
This is our first game project built with Fart.css, and is available to
[**play for free**](https://concentration.fart.tools/)! See the game in action
in the video below.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
  <iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_b_YbGOsCI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

## TypeScript introspection

The latter parts of 2024 have been focused on introspection and integration. We
identified performance issues caused by prolific libraries like Zod and TypeBox
stressing the TypeScript language server in large projects. To address this, we
began exploring TypeScript type introspection.

Our [initial approach](https://github.com/FartLabs/typescript-type-introspector)
involved synchronous analysis using tree-sitter. While insightful, this proved
less than ideal.

In December, we pivoted to a
[build-time approach](https://github.com/FartLabs/deno-doc-introspector),
leveraging [`deno doc`](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/doc/) for
more robust type information. This shift lays the groundwork for a powerful,
type-driven code generation system, enabling us to build a flexible, **Linked
Data** application framework on top of familiar TypeScript syntax, intuitively
integrating concepts from
[**Semantic Web**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) standards.

## 2025 and beyond

- Advancements in AI technology have shaped the tech landscape in 2024. FartLabs
  is researching innovative ways to leverage AI to improve user experiences.
- Thought work may prefer tactile materials over digital interfaces, FartLabs is
  exploring ways to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds.
- Our FartLabs game development studio is creating new, entertaining video game
  experiences that combine innovative gameplay mechanics with engaging
  storytelling.
- FartLabs scientists are looking forward to continuing their research into the
  intersection of developer experience, **Semantic Web** standards, and
  TypeScript introspection and code generation.
- FartLabs plans to a host a hackathon or conference event in 2025 to bring
  together developers and researchers to discuss the future of user-centric
  software development and the role of **Linked Data** in shaping the digital
  landscape.

## Learn and grow

We are building a future where users take control of their digital experience.
