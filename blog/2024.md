FartLabs has been "crop dusting" innovation and collaboration in 2024. Let's
reflect on our journey and look ahead to the future.

## A year of firsts

In 2024, FartLabs, as it is known today, was born. Our goals are ambitious, but
our vision is clear: walled gardens will fall and make room for a new era of
user-centric FOSS (free, open-source shit). Read more about
[our mission](/about).

### January: Deno Subhosting Hackathon

In January, FartLabs' journey began with a shocking start at the
[Deno Subhosting Hackathon](https://deno.com/blog/subhosting-hackathon) where
our project, [Deno Blocks](https://github.com/FartLabs/deno_blocks), won
"[Ryan Dahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl)'s Favorite" and "Most Fun"
awards. The hackathon was a fateful opportunity to showcase our technical skills
and integrate a cloud IDE with the **Deno Deploy** platform.

### February: jsonx

In February, we started developing [jsonx](https://github.com/FartLabs/jsonx), a
JSX runtime for being able to compose all kinds of JavaScript objects in a more
readable way using JSX syntax. This project has been a great success and has
been used to wrap many of our other projects.

```tsx
function Cat() {
  return { animals: ["üêà"] };
}

function Dog() {
  return { animals: ["üêï"] };
}

const data = (
  <>
    <Cat />
    <Dog />
  </>
);

console.log(data); // { animals: ["üêà", "üêï"] }
```

### March: jsonx documentation website

In March, we shipped a [jsonx documentation website](https://jsonx.fart.tools)
which includes an in-browser IDE (<https://jsonx.fart.tools/p>) where you can
experiment with the library and see the results in real-time.

### April: routing, hypertext markup, and FartLabs.org

In April, we launched [rt](https://github.com/FartLabs/rt), a TypeScript library
for conveniently handling HTTP requests. We also released
[rtx](https://github.com/FartLabs/rtx), a companion jsonx component library to
design HTTP servers via JSX syntax.

We also launched [ht](https://github.com/FartLabs/ht), a TypeScript library for
rendering HTML elements with type-safe attributes. This library is used in
[htx](https://github.com/FartLabs/htx) to render HTML elements via JSX syntax.

rtx and htx are able to play nicely together, allowing for routing and hypertext
components to be used together to create a full-stack web application via JSX
syntax in the same TypeScript file, all using one JSX runtime.

```tsx
import { A, BODY, H1, P } from "@fartlabs/htx";
import { Get, Router } from "@fartlabs/rtx";

const router = (
  <Router default={() => new Response("Not found", { status: 404 })}>
    <Get
      pattern="/"
      handle={() =>
        new Response(
          <BODY>
            <H1>Hello, World!</H1>
            <P>This is a paragraph.</P>
            <A href="https://jsr.io/@fartlabs/htx">@fartlabs/htx</A>
          </BODY>,
        )}
    />
  </Router>
);

if (import.meta.main) {
  Deno.serve((request) => router.fetch(request));
}
```

With htx, we built this website, [FartLabs.org](https://fartlabs.org)
([Learn more](https://devpost.com/software/fartlabs-fart-tools)).

Notice: fart.tools now redirects to FartLabs.org.

### May: Personal Computing R&D and QR Grid

Simultaneously, we began prototyping a practical intersection of physical and
digital worlds with [qr_grid](https://github.com/FartLabs/qr_grid). This project
generates customizable, printable QR code grids, enabling seamless transitions
between tactile materials and digital resources. Whether for research or
productivity, QR codes in physical formats, like stickers, are a step towards
bridging these realms. Inspired by
[Andrew Sutherland's talk](https://youtu.be/Y8Qm48_GhJ8), we aim to empower
thought work with accessible, hybrid interfaces.

### June

Projects started in June:

- https://github.com/FartLabs/feeder
- https://github.com/FartLabs/id.fartlabs.org
- https://github.com/FartLabs/fart.css
- https://github.com/FartLabs/concentration
- Start of social media [presence](https://go.fart.tools/api) and
  [link shortener service](https://github.com/FartLabs/go.fart.tools).

### July

In June, FartLabs embarked on a research project to explore cutting-edge
concepts in personal computing and human-computer interaction (HCI). Building
upon [Alexander Obenaur](https://alexanderobenauer.com/)'s work on itemized
operating systems, we investigated modular architectures where individual
digital objects are treated as movable, self-contained "items." This approach,
exemplified by **Obenaur**'s lab notes, presents intriguing possibilities for
user customization and seamless data integration across applications.

To further explore these concepts, we developed a
[TypeScript implementation](https://github.com/FartLabs/item_drive) of
**Obenaur**'s item drive and related concepts. This practical implementation
allowed us to experiment with real-world applications, gaining valuable insights
into the strengths and limitations of the itemized approach.

Furthermore, our research revealed that **Obenaur**'s itemized approach to
computation carries interdisciplinary relevance. We observed intriguing
similarities and potential complementarities with existing
[**Semantic Web**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) standards such as
**Linked Data** and
[**RDF**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework). This
connection suggests promising avenues for future research and development,
potentially leading to more robust and interoperable systems for managing and
sharing digital information.

### August

In August, we created an auditory memory game titled Fart Concentration. This is
our first game project built with fart.css, and is available to
[**play for free**](https://concentration.fart.tools/)! See the game in action
in the video below.

## Building our future

<!-- - TBD -->

- Advancements in AI technology have shaped the tech landscape in 2024. FartLabs
  is researching innovative ways to leverage AI to improve user experiences.
- Thought work may prefer tactile materials over digital interfaces, FartLabs is
  exploring ways to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds.

## Learning and growing at FartLabs

We are building a future where users take control of their digital experience.
By contributing to our project or advocating for open, user-centric software
development, you can be a part of this movement. Join us!
