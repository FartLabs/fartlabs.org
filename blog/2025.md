In 2025, FartLabs continued to grow and evolve. The following is a
year-in-review summary of FartLabs' activities in 2025:

## The FartLabs Shop

To demonstrate these capabilities in a real-world scenario, an open-source
e-commerce storefront was launched, selling community-driven merchandise and
serving as a test case for our `htx` and `rtx` libraries. [Learn more](/shop).

## FartHacks 2025

In March, we had the honor of hosting our premier hackathon,
[**FartHacks 2025**](/hackathon), our first major public hackathon. The event
focused on bringing together developers and researchers to build user-centric
software and explore applications of **Linked Data** and the **Semantic Web**.

It was a great opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals and share our
research and development efforts. We gained valuable feedback and insights from
participants and collaborators, which helped us refine our approach and improve
our tools.

## Library maintenance

Our core tech stack, primarily built for the **TypeScript/Deno** ecosystem, saw
significant updates as we applied lessons learned from user feedback and
approached the **FartKit 1.0** milestone.

We also introduced [go-protocol](https://github.com/FartLabs/go-protocol), an
Internet-Draft standardizing deterministic shortlink resolution, and released
its reference implementation, [@fartlabs/go](https://github.com/FartLabs/go).
These tools enable portable, reliable internal "go" links across any platform.

## Semantic Web & AI

We continued our deep dive into the **Semantic Web**, exploring how
**neuro-symbolic AI** can breathe new life into established web standards.

We developed a prototype that uses LLMs to generate and visualize **RDF graphs**
on the fly. We shared this demo with a Computer Science PhD professor—an expert
in Knowledge Representation—who was impressed by the system's ability to
construct valid knowledge graphs with minimal code. This validation fuels our
belief that utilizing AI can lower the barrier to entry for complex data
standards, making the Semantic Web accessible to everyone.

## Enter Wazoo

2025 also marked the inception of **Wazoo**, a world-models-as-a-service
platform for AI agents founded by FartLabs' creator,
[Ethan Davidson](https://etok.me). Wazoo aims to build a future where users and
software programs coexist in harmony.

Critically, Wazoo is built upon the research and open-source contributions of
FartLabs. This symbiotic relationship provides a robust engine for our continued
development, ensuring that our tools remain battle-tested and relevant in the
rapidly evolving landscape of AI and agentic computing.

## 2026 and beyond

In 2026, FartLabs will continue to be a research and development lab pushing the
boundaries of what's possible in World Wide Web innovation. We are an
open-source engineering institution—a hotspot where talented operators share and
learn principles, fundamentals, and best practices, using our software’s
principles and our manifesto as our North Star.

- **FartKit 1.0:** The coming year is dedicated to the **FartKit 1.0**
  milestone. This goal unifies our ecosystem, bringing every core subproject—
  including `jsonx`, `rt`/`rtx`, `ht`/`htx`, `agx`, `ts-derive`, and `Fart.css`—
  to a stable, production-ready release.
- We will host **FartHacks 2026**, continuing our tradition of bringing
  developers together.
- We will launch [Membership Tiers](/membership) to include new perks and
  collaborative opportunities.
- We aim to further expand our open-source sponsorship and recruitment efforts.
- We will continue to refine our TypeScript ecosystem and explore new frontiers
  in AI and Semantic Web integration.
- Continued support and alliance with [Wazoo](https://wazoo.tech).

## Learn and grow

Our research lab develops the TypeScript libraries that developers use to build
open-source, full-stack AI applications downloaded hundreds of times per month.
By contributing to our project or advocating for open, user-centric software
development, you can be a part of this movement. Join us!
