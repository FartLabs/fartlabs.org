Software shapes every aspect of our digital lives, yet most applications treat
users as interchangeable. We believe software should be a true extension of
ourselves: adaptable, responsive, and uniquely yours.

Leveraging the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web), we're
building software primitives that put you in control. These foundational tools
enable seamless integration across applications, empowering you to craft
experiences that genuinely serve your needs.

## Software as unique as you are

Personal computing should be deeply personal, a digital extension of who you
are. Instead, we're trapped in software designed for a mythical "average user"
that doesn't exist. This one-size-fits-all approach crushes individuality and
wastes incalculable potential. Much like passing gas in a quiet room, we're
forced to contain ourselves, rather than the software adapting to us.

Individuals from around the world have joined the movement to reclaim personal
computing.

Inspired by decades of sci-fi and technological groundwork, we have the
opportunity to shape a future where technology truly serves our needs. By
challenging the biased, self-serving agendas and walled gardens that dominate
the tech industry, we can take control of our digital experiences.

      title="EDGEDANCER by Michael Whelan"
      alt="A woman in a white linen shawl dances carefree along a high grassy ridge that bends and twists into the hazy distance. She glances not at the narrow footing ahead but off to the side. Her arms are out for balance while her eyes are pressed shut as if she's lost in thought. Far ahead along the upper edge of the painting breaks are visible along the ridge. Vertical segments stand like the legs of a broken bridge with gray sky showing through as the wall-like rim meanders to the edge of the painting and back. Shorter impassable segments come more frequently as the trail winds back into nothingness. The woman sees none of it as she daintily high steps in the foreground. Low clusters of wildflowers sit lilac on the verdant green grass as the occasional butterfly hovers nearby."

## Our vision

We envision a future where your digital tools don't just exist, they work
together, adapting seamlessly to your unique needs. We're building that future
using the principles of the Semantic Web, creating software that empowers you to
connect different applications and build a truly personalized digital
environment.

Imagine effortlessly linking your work calendar with your family's messaging
app, or building a custom dashboard that pulls real-time information from all
the sources that matter to you. The profound impact of this lies in the
"semantic" design of technology that understands the meaning behind your data.

Our goal is to merge modern neuro-symbolic AI and web technologies into a
platform where you are the operator, living a digital experience that is truly
yours, cohesive, and in harmony with the greater world around you.

## Family tradition

Our lab's mission is inspired by my late uncle, Gregory Davidson. Uncle Gregory
was a dedicated programmer and a creative, playful spirit, highlighted by his
wonderfully funny projectsâ€”including his film series, "Fart Movie" and "Fart
Movie 2."

Gregory was also Deaf, having been born without hearing. Farts, as it turns out,
transcend boundaries. The vibrations are universally funny, creating a shared,
physical experience of humor that everyone can feel, even Deaf individuals, like
my uncle.

Our close friendship gave me a profound perspective on how hearing-impaired
individuals experience the world. It taught me that when you love someone, you
create your own unique language to connect. This instilled in me a lifelong
appreciation for the diverse ways we all communicate with each other and
technology.

Our lab is a tribute to Gregory's playful, brave, powerful, and righteous
spirit. We are building a platform that celebrates our differences, empowering
everyone to cultivate deeper connections and realize their unique potential with
the help of technology that truly understands them. ðŸ¤Ÿ
