In today's world, software is crucial in everything we do. However, many
applications prioritize generic functionality over individual needs. We believe
software should be an extension of ourselves, adaptable and responsive to our
unique preferences.

Inspired by philosophies like the
[Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web), we aim to develop
software primitives that empower users. These building blocks will enable
seamless integration between different applications, allowing users to create
personalized experiences that truly serve their needs.

## Software as unique as you are

Personal computing has the potential to be a deeply personalized experience, a
digital extension of ourselves. Yet, the software we rely on often falls short
of this ideal. While we have the tools to connect with others, capture moments,
and explore the world, the underlying software is designed for a generic
"average user." This one-size-fits-all approach stifles individuality and limits
the potential of our devices. Much like passing gas in a quiet room, we're
forced to adapt to the software, rather than the software adapting to us.

Individuals from around the world have joined the movement to reclaim personal
computing.

Inspired by decades of science fiction and technological advancements, we gained
the opportunity to shape a future where technology truly serves our needs. By
challenging the biased, self-serving agendas and walled gardens that dominate
the tech industry, we can take control of our digital experiences.

      alt="A woman in a white linen shawl dances carefree along a high grassy ridge that bends and twists into the hazy distance. She glances not at the narrow footing ahead but off to the side. Her arms are out for balance while her eyes are pressed shut as if she's lost in thought. Far ahead along the upper edge of the painting breaks are visible along the ridge. Vertical segments stand like the legs of a broken bridge with gray sky showing through as the wall-like rim meanders to the edge of the painting and back. Shorter impassable segments come more frequently as the trail winds back into nothingness. The woman sees none of it as she daintily high steps in the foreground. Low clusters of wildflowers sit lilac on the verdant green grass as the occasional butterfly hovers nearby."

## Our vision

We envision a future where digital tools seamlessly integrate, adapting to
unique needs. We're building software based on Semantic Web principles, which
empower users to connect different applications and create a truly personalized
digital environment.

Imagine effortlessly linking a communication app with a calendar, or building a
custom dashboard that aggregates information from all favorite sources. The
profound impact of this lies in the semantic nature of our software, enabling it
to autonomously create systems that adapt and evolve with user needs. This isn't
just theoretically possible — we're making it a reality. Our software will give
users the control to build the workflows that works best for them.

## Family tradition

Our mission wouldn't exist without the inspiration of a truly unique individual
— my late uncle, Gregory Davidson. Uncle Gregory wasn't just a man who loved a
good fart joke (and let's be honest, who doesn't?), he was utterly dedicated to
the comedic power of flatulence.

His passion manifested in the form of the "Fart Movie" series — a self-made
collection of the funniest and most informative fart moments from popular movies
and television shows. But Gregory's ambition went beyond mere compilation. He
wrote, directed, animated, and even narrated some original scenes.

Gregory was also Deaf since birth, and our close friendship gave me perspective
into how hearing-impaired people experience the world. It instilled in me a
lifelong appreciation for the diverse ways we communicate and connect in our own
unique ways.

FartLabs is, in many ways, an extension of Gregory's playful spirit. We want to
create a platform that celebrates the universal language of laughter, one that
transcends spoken words and embraces the joy of a good fart. We believe, just
like Gregory, that laughter breaks down barriers and connects us all.
