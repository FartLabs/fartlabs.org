## Open Role

**Location:** Remote

We’re always looking for builders excited about developer tools, games, and
user‑centric software. Choose a path:

- Apply for an open role as an employee (full benefits)
- Apply to our OSS Sponsorship Track (custom, per-project)

## OSS Sponsorship Track (custom, per-project)

Prefer to stay independent while contributing to OSS? We offer custom
sponsorships without fixed public tiers.

- Expectations: ~1 solid PR/month or several smaller fixes; flexible.
- Process: Short application form → quick intro call → proposal/fit → start.
- Scope: FartLabs repos + adjacent ecosystem work that advances our mission.

Apply here and select "OSS Sponsorship":
