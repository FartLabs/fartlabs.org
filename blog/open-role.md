## Open Role

**Location:** Remote

Our team is always on the lookout for trailblazing scientists, engineers, and
strategic thinkers who get fired up about developer tools, game development, and
building user-centric software. If this sounds like your jam, just fill out an
application and we'll reach out if there's a good fit!

## About FartLabs

FartLabs is all about building developer tools, games, and innovative projects
that actually put users in control of their digital experience. Founded in 2024,
we've already made some pretty cool contributions to the developer community
with projects like Deno Blocks, jsonx, rt/rtx, ht/htx, and Fart.css.

Our mission is to create intergenerational software for a personalized digital
experience. We believe software should be an extension of ourselves, adaptable
and responsive to our unique preferences. Inspired by philosophies like the
Semantic Web, we're building software primitives that let users seamlessly
integrate different applications and create truly personalized digital
environments.

In 2024, we rocked the Deno Subhosting Hackathon with our project Deno Blocks,
earning "Ryan Dahl's Favorite" and "Most Fun" awards (pretty sweet, right?).
We've also launched some awesome projects like Fart Concentration (our first
game), qr_grid for bridging physical and digital worlds, and various TypeScript
libraries that make development way more enjoyable and efficient.
