## Join the FartLabs research lab

We're excited to announce the launch of **FartLabs Membership**, a way for our
community to support our mission of imagination-driven development while gaining
access to exclusive content, personalized support, and hands-on enablement.

Our membership model is designed around the principle of **enabling "doing"
rather than restricting "knowing"**. We believe in open access to ideas while
providing hands-on support for implementation.

> **Note:** This is a work in progress. We're still ironing out the details and
> will be updating this page as we go. If you have any questions, please reach
> out to us on our [Discord](https://go.fart.tools/chat).
